* heavy.obj
It was exported by Max, it only has two values in the vertex specifies for each face vertex.
It gives position and texture coordinate and expects the reading application to generate vertex normals.

* sword_demon.obj
It was also exported by Max (prob a different Max, somehow) and has no material specified before the faces begin.
Also has tiny tiny vertex normals.

* minhrifle.obj
The AO looks like crap without proper smoothing groups loaded. Lots of smoothing groups in this model.

* smoothinggroups.obj
A simple model with the top face in a separate smoothing group.

* car1backwheel.obj
Negative vertex indices
Turning smoothing groups off

* bigmodel.obj
It's minhrifle.obj copied twice, which results in a 10k poly model, to test loading times.

* occ_test.obj
Has no UV. Exported from LightWave with no vt entries and the second value in each vertex empty.
